            <p>This is a <strong>2007 BMW 328i Sedan</strong> with Automatic transmission and ONLY 68k miles on it. The cars exterior is <strong>Sparkling Graphite Metallic</strong> with black leather seats and brushed aluminium panels. As you can see by the pictures, the car is in excellent condition with a few tasteful modifications to make it really stand out. The car has a CLEAN TITLE, is clean inside and out, and runs and drives great.  This car is a show car. You will get compliments from just about everywhere you go, as many enthusiasts consider the car <strong>"done perfectly".</strong></p>
            <p>I <strong>purchased this Certified Pre-Owned</strong> Car in June of 2010 from BMW Dealership in Las Vegas, NV. I am the <strong>second owner</strong> of this beautiful machine and have taken pristine care of the car. The car was always hand washed with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/32oz-Optimum-Rinse-Wash-Shine/dp/B000E9TS6O/ref=pd_sim_auto_1" target="_blank">high quality waterless wash</a> to ensure the paint stays immaculate. It also recently underwent professional detail and paint correction to make the car really shine! </p>
            <p>All body work was done at a prestigious shop in Plano, TX: <a href="http://www.newconceptautoworks.com/" target="_blank"> <strong>New Concept Autoworks.</strong></a> New Concepts does all the work on the local high end cars. </p>
            <p>There are a few very minor imperfections and rock chips. Since I want you to be as informed as possible in your buying decision, I did my best to disclose all issues with the car in the pictures towards the bottom.</p>
            <p>This car is being sold as-is, without any existing warranty. The CPO recently warranty expired in May 2013. Please don't hesitate to contact me to ask any questions at all.</p>
